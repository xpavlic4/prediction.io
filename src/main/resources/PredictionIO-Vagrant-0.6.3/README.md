Bring Up PredictionIO VM with Vagrant
======================================

Vagrant is an open source tool for simplifying the download and setup steps of
a virtual machine (VM) with VirtualBox. It is recommended for a quick
PredictionIO installation in a testing or development environment, as it will
save you from many of the common pitfalls of the installation process.

Please refer to our
[documentation site](http://docs.prediction.io/current/installation/install-predictionio-with-virtualbox-vagrant.html)
for detailed usage and setup.
